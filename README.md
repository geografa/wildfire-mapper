## Daily Wildfire Mapper (deprecated)

V2.0 is now [here](https://github.com/abenrob/us_fire_compare)!

This example uses the Mapbox javascript mapping library to read individual locations from an external geojson file. The file comes from csv list of current daily fires from this location: <http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/lg_fire2.php#>. Still working on a converter for the csv to json.
